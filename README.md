### Articula: AI-generated Content Detection and Understanding with Low-resource Training and Augmentations Resources

This repository presents implementation for the tool Articula: AI-generated Content Detection and Understanding with Low-resource Training and Augmentations. The Articula tool analyzes both input images and texts to detect whether they are generated by AI models.

### Developer Guidelines

1. For setting up the project, use the `source project-setup.sh` command, and it will set up a virtual environment with prerequisite packages.

### Pull Request Instructions

1. Create a specific branch named in the format like `feature/intrinsic-dimension-model`, highlighting the name of the feature model in progress and make a pull request.

2. Always `rebase` the your working branch before making a PR and add `--force-with-lease` based branch push. Also, we highlight the steps needed for making a PR below assuming that you are working on your feature branch and you can opt to remove conflicts via your IDE while doing the `rebase` for your branch.

```
git checkout main
git pull origin
git checkout feature/intrinsic-dimension-model
git rebase main
git push origin feature/intrinsic-dimension-model --force-with-lease
```

3. Finally, after reviewing the pull request, please `squash`` all the commits during the merge into the main branch. Also, add in meaningful PR heading and joint-commit message for all your intermediate commits.

__Note:__ Please, do not push directly onto the main branch, follow the proposed conventions, and also add another person as reviewer of your code.
